# Object-Oriented Programming Course Project (Java)

This is a university course project for the Object-Oriented Programming class at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

The main goal of this project was to design and implement a small Java application using clean object-oriented design:
- Separate responsibilities into classes
- Use inheritance and interfaces appropriately
- Write code that is readable and easy to extend

## Overview

The application is a small simulation-style program.
It models several types of objects and how they interact with each other over time.

(Here you can write 2–3 lines about what exactly it does: for example, a world simulator, avatars moving on a grid, terrain, etc.)

## Technologies

- Language: Java
- Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming

## What I learned

- Designing a program using OOP principles
- Splitting logic across multiple classes
- Reading a specification and turning it into working code
